<div><h1>Software Requirements Specification (SRS)</h1>
    <p><h1> <strong>For</strong> </h1></p>

    <p><h1>Project Name here</h1></p> <br>

    <p> <strong> Version 1.0 Approved </strong> </p> <br>

    <p>The IEEE has a different standard for a "Software Requirements
    Document" (SRD), which is IEEE/EAI 12207.1-1997.  If you look in the table
    at the back of IEEE Std 830-1998 you will see the cross reference
    tables in Appendix B, showing that these are consistent with one another.</p>

    <p>Standards are periodically updated, so there are several
        versions of IEE STd 830, including IEEE Std 830-1983, -1993, and
        -1998.  These standards also allow some room for discretion.
        It therefore follows that you may see several different suggested
        table of contents outlines for SRS documents purporting to
        be based on this standard.</p>

    <h2>1.4 Product Scope</h2>
    <p>Snippet is a cross platform web crawling and scrapping application that allows users to 
	source and save specific text information about their topic of interest in the form of a cluster,
	which is essentially is a list of saved text files after a webpage is crawled for certain information.
	The application is cross platform, versatile and can be used for a multitude of search and list 
	activities, ideal for research work, data sourcing, collecting text resources etc. It will allow
	users to extract extensive information across multiple URL’s with just a click of a button, save
	it and access it anytime, anywhere. The in-depth search feature can dig through URLs within URLs 
	to maximize the output of a search result making the process as swift and easy as possible. 
	With such a powerful tool at hand, research and data sourcing will be easier than ever before.</p>

<h1>2. Overall Description</h1>

<div>
    <h2>2.1 Product Perspective</h2>
    <p>Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state 
        whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing 
        systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, 
        relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify 
        iv><br>

<br><br>


interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall 
        system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful</p>
</div><br>

<div>
    <h2>2.2 Product Functions</h2>
    <p>Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will 
        be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. 
        Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the 
        major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or 
        object class diagram, is often effective.</p>
</div><br>

<div>
    <h2>2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h2>
    <p>Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be 
        differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, 
        security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics 
        of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the 
        most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.</p>
</div><br>

<div>
    <h2>2.4 Operating Environment</h2>
    <p>Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the hardware platform, 
        operating system and versions, and any other software components or applications with which it 
        must peacefully coexist.</p>
</div><br>

<div>
    <h2>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h2>
    <p>Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might 
        include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory 
        requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be 
        used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security 
        considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customer’s 
        organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).</p>
</div><br>

<div>
    <h2>2.6 User Documentation</h2>
    <p>List the user documentation components (such as user manuals, on-line help, and tutorials) that 
        will be delivered along with the software. Identify any known user documentation delivery formats 
        or standards.</p>
</div><br>

<div>
    <h2>2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h2>
    <p>List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in 
        the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues 
        around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if 
        these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the 
        project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from 
        another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and 
        scope document or the project plan).</p>
