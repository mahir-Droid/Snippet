<div><h1>Software Requirements Specification (SRS)</h1>
    <p><h1> <strong>For</strong> </h1></p>

    <p><h1>Project Name here</h1></p> <br>

    <p> <strong> Version 1.0 Approved </strong> </p> <br>

    <p>The IEEE has a different standard for a "Software Requirements
    Document" (SRD), which is IEEE/EAI 12207.1-1997.  If you look in the table
    at the back of IEEE Std 830-1998 you will see the cross reference
    tables in Appendix B, showing that these are consistent with one another.</p>

    <p>Standards are periodically updated, so there are several
        versions of IEE STd 830, including IEEE Std 830-1983, -1993, and
        -1998.  These standards also allow some room for discretion.
        It therefore follows that you may see several different suggested
        table of contents outlines for SRS documents purporting to
        be based on this standard.</p>

    <h2>1.4 Product Scope</h2>
    <p>Snippet is a cross platform web crawling and scrapping application that allows users to 
	source and save specific text information about their topic of interest in the form of a cluster,
	which is essentially is a list of saved text files after a webpage is crawled for certain information.
	The application is cross platform, versatile and can be used for a multitude of search and list 
	activities, ideal for research work, data sourcing, collecting text resources etc. It will allow
	users to extract extensive information across multiple URL’s with just a click of a button, save
	it and access it anytime, anywhere. The in-depth search feature can dig through URLs within URLs 
	to maximize the output of a search result making the process as swift and easy as possible. 
	With such a powerful tool at hand, research and data sourcing will be easier than ever before.</p>

<h1>2. Overall Description</h1>

<div>
    <h2>2.1 Product Perspective</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
    <p>Snippet simply is a web crawler that browses a URL to condense and display its contents in a way that is most effective and informative to the user. The idea is to make text data extraction efficient, fast and thorough as it makes research and data sourcing a lot easier, all the user has to provide is the link to crawl and the depth to which it is to be crawled. The system will distill the related documents in the form of a cluster which the user can save or revisit according to their liking. Search strategies can also be customized by the user where they can specify the type of data to extract from the URLs (only text documents in this case). In a world experiencing information explosion, harvesting data out of the internet pool is becoming less feasible every second; that is where Snippet comes in. Data mining, analyzing market demand, monitoring competitor prices are few of the many advantages of using Snippet. A tool powerful enough to extract targeted data rapidly and efficiently. </p>
=======
    <p>Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this SRS. For example, state 
        whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing 
        systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the SRS defines a component of a larger system, 
        relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify 
        iv><br>

<div>
    <h2>2.2 Product Functions</h2>
    <p>A Snippet Account user can do the following:

        1.	Crawl URLs
        
        •	Users can provide one or multiple URLs to be crawled simultaneously.
        •	They can specify the type of text documents they want to extract.
        •	Crawling depth must be specified to crawl links successfully.
        
        2.	Create Cluster
        
        •	Clusters can be named and saved to be accessed at all times.
        •	View saved clusters and its details.
        •	Existing clusters can be searched, deleted, modified etc.
        •	Export search results.
        
        </p>
</div><br>

<div>
    <h2>2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h2>
    <p>Snippet has an extensively diverse user class considering it can help businesses with their market research and be at the top of their game, and it can also help a college students obtain data for their machine learning project. Anyone can crawl the web for text documents for research, data analysis, data extraction, monitoring market prices etc. </p>

<h1>3.  External Interface Requirements</h1>

<div>
    <h2>3.1 User Interfaces</h2>
    <p>
       Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. 
        This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are 
        to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions  that will 
        appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on.The user 
		interface must be secure, convenient and extensible. Security requirements 
	include the need to protect authorization information from unauthorized access, the maintenance 
	of customer confidentiality.Since the user interface environment shall be organized during the development
	phase as a flexible, easy-to-update, dynamically configurable system.Define the software components 
	for which a user interface is needed. There are four types of user interfaces.These are Command Line Interface,
Menu-driven Interface, Graphical User Interface, Touchscreen Graphical User Interface. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a 
	separate user interface specification.</p>
